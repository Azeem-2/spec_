# Research: Image Enhancement Website

## Technical Approach

### Framework Selection
- **Next.js 15.5.4**: Latest stable version with App Router for full-stack development
- **React 19.2.0**: Latest version for component-based UI
- **TypeScript**: Type safety for maintainable code

### Image Processing
- **Sharp 0.34.4**: Latest high-performance Node.js library for image manipulation
- Enhancement operations: Brightness adjustment, contrast enhancement, sharpening
- Input formats: JPEG, PNG (as per spec)
- Output: Enhanced JPEG/PNG

### Architecture
- **Frontend**: React components for upload form, progress display, download
- **Backend**: Next.js API routes for file processing
- **File Handling**: Temporary storage during processing, streamed responses
- **Error Handling**: Validation, processing failures with user feedback

### Performance Considerations
- Sharp's native performance for <30s processing goal
- File size limits (<10MB) to prevent resource exhaustion
- Asynchronous processing to avoid blocking UI

### Security
- File type validation
- Size limits to prevent abuse
- No persistent storage of user images

### Dependencies
- next: ^15.5.4
- react: ^19.2.0
- sharp: ^0.34.4
- @types/node, typescript for dev

### Setup Process
Run CLI command: `npx create-next-app@latest image-enhancer --typescript --tailwind --eslint --app --src-dir --import-alias "@/*"`
Then install Sharp: `npm install sharp`
Create App Router structure
Implement upload API with Sharp processing
Build UI components with progress and download

### Alternatives Considered
- Client-side processing: Limited by browser capabilities, security issues
- External AI services: Adds complexity and cost, not specified in requirements
- Multiple enhancement options: Keep simple per spec, focus on basic enhancement
