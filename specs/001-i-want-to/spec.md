# Feature Specification: Image Enhancement Website

**Feature Branch**: `001-i-want-to`  
**Created**: 2025-10-04  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "i want to create a website where i give image and it enchace that pic"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user, I want to upload an image to the website so that it can be enhanced and I can download the improved version.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a valid image file (JPEG, PNG), **When** I upload it through the website interface, **Then** the system processes the enhancement and provides a download link for the enhanced image.
2. **Given** an invalid file type, **When** I attempt to upload, **Then** the system displays an error message and rejects the upload.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the image file is larger than 10MB? System MUST reject the upload and display an error message.
- How does the system handle corrupted image files?
- What if enhancement processing fails? System MUST display an error message and allow the user to retry the enhancement.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to upload image files via web interface
- **FR-002**: System MUST validate uploaded files are supported image formats (JPEG, PNG)
- **FR-003**: System MUST enhance uploaded images using image processing algorithms
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide download functionality for enhanced images
- **FR-005**: System MUST display progress during enhancement processing

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: System MUST maintain consistent user experience across all interfaces
- **NFR-002**: Architecture MUST be maintainable with modular design
- **NFR-003**: Performance MUST meet enhancement processing time <30 seconds for standard images

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Image**: Represents uploaded and enhanced image files, with attributes like file name, size, format, and processing status
- **Enhancement**: Represents the enhancement process applied to images, with attributes like processing time and result quality

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-04
- Q: What is the maximum file size allowed for image uploads? ‚Üí A: 10mb
- Q: How should the system handle enhancement processing failures? ‚Üí A: Display error message and allow manual retry
- Q: What additional image formats should be supported beyond JPEG and PNG? ‚Üí A: none
