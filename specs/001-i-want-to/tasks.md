# Tasks: Image Enhancement Website

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-i-want-to/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → If not found: ERROR "No implementation plan found"
   → Extract: tech stack, libraries, structure
2. Load optional design documents:
   → data-model.md: Extract entities → model tasks
   → contracts/: Each file → implementation task
   → research.md: Extract decisions → setup tasks
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: project init, dependencies, linting
   → Core: models, services, CLI commands
   → Integration: DB, middleware, logging
   → Polish: performance, docs, quality checks
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Dependencies block parallel execution
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Validate task completeness:
   → All entities have models?
   → All endpoints implemented?
9. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```

## Format: `[ID] [P?] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Next.js project**: `image-enhancer/src/app/`, `image-enhancer/src/components/`, `image-enhancer/src/lib/`
- Paths relative to feature directory

## Phase 3.1: Setup
- [x] T001 Verify Next.js project setup in image-enhancer/
- [x] T002 Ensure all dependencies installed (Next.js, React, Sharp)

## Phase 3.2: Core Implementation
- [x] T003 [P] Create UploadForm component in image-enhancer/src/components/UploadForm.tsx
- [x] T004 [P] Create ProgressBar component in image-enhancer/src/components/ProgressBar.tsx
- [x] T005 [P] Create DownloadButton component in image-enhancer/src/components/DownloadButton.tsx
- [x] T006 Create imageProcessor utility in image-enhancer/src/lib/imageProcessor.ts
- [x] T007 Implement POST /api/enhance route in image-enhancer/src/app/api/enhance/route.ts
- [x] T008 Update main page in image-enhancer/src/app/page.tsx to integrate components

## Phase 3.3: Integration
- [ ] No integration tasks required

## Phase 3.4: Polish
- [x] T009 Performance check for enhancement processing <30 seconds
- [x] T010 Update README.md with usage instructions
- [x] T011 Code quality review and linting compliance
- [x] T012 Architecture maintainability check (modularity, separation of concerns)
- [x] T013 UX consistency validation (if UI involved)

## Dependencies
- Setup (T001-T002) before core
- Components (T003-T005) can run in parallel
- imageProcessor (T006) can run parallel with components
- API route (T007) after imageProcessor
- Main page (T008) after API route and components
- Polish (T009-T013) after all implementation

## Parallel Example
```
# Launch T003-T005 together:
Task: "Create UploadForm component in image-enhancer/src/components/UploadForm.tsx"
Task: "Create ProgressBar component in image-enhancer/src/components/ProgressBar.tsx"
Task: "Create DownloadButton component in image-enhancer/src/components/DownloadButton.tsx"
```

## Notes
- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- Commit after each task
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts

## Task Generation Rules
*Applied during main() execution*

1. **From Data Model**:
   - Each entity → utility/model task [P]
   - Relationships → service layer tasks
   
2. **From Contracts**:
   - Each contract file → implementation task
   
3. **From User Stories**:
   - Each story → integration task [P]
   - Quickstart scenarios → validation tasks

4. **Ordering**:
   - Setup → Core → Integration → Polish
   - Dependencies block parallel execution

## Validation Checklist
*GATE: Checked by main() before returning*

- [ ] All components created
- [ ] API endpoint implemented
- [ ] Main page updated
- [ ] Performance requirements met
- [ ] Documentation updated
