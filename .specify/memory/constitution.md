# Spec Kit Plus Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Code Quality Standards
All code must adhere to established quality standards including code reviews and adherence to coding conventions. Automated linting must pass before any merge. Rationale: Ensures reliability and reduces technical debt.

### II. User Experience Consistency
User interfaces and interactions must maintain consistency across all platforms and devices. Design patterns and user flows should be standardized to ensure predictable and intuitive experiences. Rationale: Builds user trust and reduces learning curve.

### III. Maintainable Architecture
System architecture must prioritize modularity, separation of concerns, and clean code principles. Components should be loosely coupled with clear interfaces to facilitate future changes and maintenance. Rationale: Enables long-term sustainability and easier evolution.

### IV. High Performance Requirements
All features must meet defined performance benchmarks. Code must be optimized for efficiency, with regular performance monitoring and profiling to identify and address bottlenecks. Rationale: Delivers responsive user experiences and efficient resource utilization.

## Additional Requirements
Technology stack must support the core principles. Security best practices must be integrated. Compliance with accessibility standards is mandatory.

## Development Workflow
All changes require specification via /specify, planning via /plan, and task breakdown via /tasks. Implementation follows structured development. Code reviews mandatory for all merges.

## Governance
Constitution supersedes all other practices. Amendments require consensus and documentation. All PRs must verify compliance with principles.
